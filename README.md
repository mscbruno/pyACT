# pyACT
This is a simple code for calculating the kinetics of acetaminophen oxidation over modified TiO2 catalysts. The idea behind the model is that by a fitting process it should be possible to obtain an estimation of the major mechanisms underlying the process.
It should be used with caution and only for internal comparison, as it does not have all the theory and data required for calculating absolute kinetics.
The library requirements are specified in the first lines of the code.
The file ACT_Mech_main is the main executable, and uses the functions defined in pyMechACT.
An input file is required, containing the experimental information examplified in the file TiO2.csv.
